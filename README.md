#  Mumbai House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict housing prices in Mumbai using machine learning models. The dataset includes details such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.
##  Problem Statement
To develop a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of a house in Mumbai based on key features like location, area, BHK, and amenities.
## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**File:** <a href="https://github.com/suhel9/Mumbi-Housing_Price_ML_Project/blob/main/Mumbai%20House%20Prices.csv">`Mumbai House Prices.csv`</a>
This dataset contains information like:
- Area (in sqft)
- Location
- Price
- Bedrooms (BHK)
- Bathrooms
- Furnishing status
- Transaction type (Resale/New)

##  Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Building Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Price distribution by location
   - Area vs price scatter plots
   - Correlation heatmap

3. **Modeling**
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²
  

##  Results
- Best model: Random Forest Regressor
- RÂ² Score: 0.88
- RMSE: â‚¹7,113,712
- MAE (in Rupees):â‚¹2,845,594
